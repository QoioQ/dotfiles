# Dotfiles
These are QoioQ's shell configuration dotfiles.
I'm running on [Mac OSX 10.10 Yosemite](http://www.apple.com/osx/).

## Installation
See [technicalpickles/homesick](https://github.com/technicalpickles/homesick) for setup.

``` sh
gem install homesick

homesick clone git://github.com/QoioQ/dotfiles.git

# `clone` doesn't update submodules, but `pull` does.
homesick pull dotfiles

homesick symlink dotfiles
```
